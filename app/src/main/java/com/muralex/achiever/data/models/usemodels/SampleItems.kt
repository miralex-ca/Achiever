While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, these 50 places are bound to take your breath away with their awe-inspiring settings.",

Rhossili Bay's white sand, saltwater and freshwater marshes, towering cliffs and sparkling blue water attract summer visitors in droves. Come at sunset to hear the gulls, blackcaps, warblers and goldcrests, and stay to watch the stars rise over the quiet beach.",

Remoteness is one of the sight's greatest assets, so expect to walk after driving to the Stokksnes peninsula to get the most stunning views. On sunny days, reflections in the water lapping on the black sand shore accentuate the unusual peaks.",

Part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Pitons Management Area, the Pitons feature fumaroles, hot springs, petroglyphs and ample wildlife-viewing opportunities. At 2,619 feet, Gros Piton is the taller and easier of the two to climb, though Petit Piton looks nearly identical in height when seen from the north.",

The best way to view the area's upright karst formations is on a licensed three-day cruise. These excursions include time to explore the bay and some of its more remote islands before and after visitors from Hanoi arrive.",

Visit between the end of June and early August and you'll see (and smell) acres of blooming lavender plants. The herb's oil, which is known for its medicinal qualities, is pressed in local distilleries and workshops that welcome travelers, but for more insight about the plant, head to the Lavender Museum in Coustellet.",
